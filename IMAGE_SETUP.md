# Image Setup Instructions

For the portfolio to display correctly, please move your images to the `public/images/` folder:

1. Move `images/me.jpg` → `public/images/me.jpg`
2. Move `images/robot.png` → `public/images/robot.png`

The HeroSection component is already configured to use these paths (`/images/me.jpg` and `/images/robot.png`), which is the standard Next.js way to reference static assets.
